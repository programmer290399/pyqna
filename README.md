**PyQnA** is a simple package that aims to provide a consistent and unified API for all Question Answering related tasks in Python. 


## Installation 
* Currently we provide a PyPi package:
    ```bash
    $ pip install pyqna
    ```
* In future we'd also have a Conda package.

## Example:

```python
# Import a specific model
from pyqna.models.reading_comprehension.transformer_models import TransformerQnAModel

# Instantiate the model
model = TransformerQnAModel(
    {"model_name": "distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad", "pre_trained": True}
)

# Take a context 
context = """ 
New Zealand (MƒÅori: Aotearoa) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi), and a population of
4.9 million. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.
"""

# Make a list of your queries
questions = ["How many people live in New Zealand?", "What's the largest city?"]

# Run inference using the instantiated models
answers = model.get_answer(context, questions)

# Print the output
print(answers)
```
**Output:**
```bash
['4. 9 million', 'auckland']
```
